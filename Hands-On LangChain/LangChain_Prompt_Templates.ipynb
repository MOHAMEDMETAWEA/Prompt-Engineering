    "# \ud83e\udde0 Understanding LangChain Prompt Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udca1 Introduction\n",
    "By prompting an **LLM (Large Language Model)**, it\u2019s possible to develop complex AI applications much faster than ever before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, an application may require prompting an LLM **multiple times** and **parsing its output**, which means a lot of *glue code* must be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \u2699\ufe0f How LangChain Helps\n",
    "**LangChain** simplifies this process by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing a clear and simple set of **abstractions** for handling LLM operations.  \n",
    "- Offering **Prompt Templates**, which make it easier to create, organize, and reuse prompts efficiently.\n",

    "# \ud83e\udde9 3. Why Do We Need LangChain Prompt Templates?\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udca1 The Reason Behind Using Prompt Templates\n",
    "We use **Prompt Templates** instead of simple **f-strings** because, as applications become more **sophisticated**, the prompts you write can become **long and detailed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Templates provide a **helpful abstraction** that allows you to:\n",
    "- Reuse effective prompts easily.  \n",
    "- Keep your code clean and well-structured.  \n",
    "- Reduce repetition and human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83e\udde0 Example\n",
    "Consider a relatively long prompt designed to **evaluate a student\u2019s solution** and determine whether it\u2019s correct or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Such prompts can:\n",
    "- Ask the **LLM to solve a problem first**,  \n",
    "- Then **output the result in a specific format**,  \n",
    "- Possibly even include **multiple steps** of reasoning and formatting instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### \ud83d\udcdd Summary\n",
    "Using **LangChain Prompt Templates** helps you:\n",
    "- Manage complex and lengthy prompts.  \n",
    "- Maintain clarity and consistency.  \n",
    "- Reuse high-quality prompt designs across your project.\n",
