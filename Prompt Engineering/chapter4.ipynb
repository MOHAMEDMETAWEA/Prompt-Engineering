It provides a structured way to build applications that leverage the capabilities of LLMs for various tasks, such as natural language understanding, generation, and interaction.\n\nHere are some key features and components of LangChain:\n\n1. **Modularity**: LangChain is built with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily integrate different components, such as LLMs, tools, and data sources. This modularity makes it easier to customize applications according to specific needs.\n\n2. **Chains**: The concept of \"chains\" is central to LangChain. Chains are sequences of calls to LLMs or other components that process input in a structured way. For example, a chain might first parse a user's query, then generate a response, and finally format that response for output.\n\n3. **Agents**: LangChain supports the creation of agents that can perform tasks based on user input. Agents can utilize LLMs to understand context and make decisions about which actions to take, often involving multiple steps or interactions.\n\n4. **Memory**: LangChain includes features for managing memory, allowing applications to retain context across interactions. This is particularly useful for building conversational agents that need to remember previous exchanges with users.\n\n5. **Integrations**: LangChain can be integrated with various external APIs, databases, and tools, enabling developers to build more complex applications that go beyond simple text generation.\n\n6. **Use Cases**: LangChain can be applied to a wide range of use cases, including chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, data analysis, and more. Its flexibility allows developers to tailor applications to specific domains or industries.\n\n7. **Community and Ecosystem**: LangChain has a growing community and ecosystem, with resources, documentation, and examples that support developers in building their applications.\n\nOverall, LangChain aims to streamline the process of building applications that harness the power of large language models, making it easier for developers to create sophisticated and interactive experiences.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":["system_context = SystemMessage(\n","    content=\"You are a colleague who works in network security and you have to advise me on a problem\"\n",")\n","\n","human_message = HumanMessage(\n","    content=\"I received an email and I think I clicked on a malicious link.

Here are steps you can follow to check if your device may have been compromised:\\n\\n1. **Disconnect from the Internet**: Immediately disconnect your device from the internet to prevent any potential data exfiltration or further malicious activity.\\n\\n2. **Run Antivirus/Malware Scans**: Use a reputable antivirus or anti-malware program to scan your device. Make sure the software is up to date. Perform a full system scan to identify and remove any threats.\\n\\n3. **Check for Unusual Activity**:\\n   - **Task Manager/Activity Monitor**: Open the Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) and look for any unfamiliar processes or applications running.\\n   - **Startup Programs**: Check your startup programs to see if any unknown applications are set to launch on boot.\\n   - **Installed Programs**: Review your installed programs for anything that looks suspicious or that you don’t remember installing.\\n\\n4. **Review Browser Extensions**: Check your web browser for any unknown or suspicious extensions that may have been added. Remove any that you do not recognize.\\n\\n5. **Change Passwords**: Change your passwords for important accounts, especially if you entered any credentials after clicking the link. Use a strong, unique password for each account, and consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible.\\n\\n6. **Check for Unusual Account Activity**: Log in to your important accounts (email, banking, etc.) and review recent activity for any unauthorized access. Look for login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices.\\n\\n7. **Monitor Network Traffic**: If you have the capability, use network monitoring tools to check for unusual outgoing traffic or connections to unknown IP addresses.\\n\\n8. **Update Software**: Make sure your operating system and all applications are updated to the latest versions, as updates often include security patches.\\n\\n9. **Backup Important Data**: If you haven’t already, back up your important files to an external drive or cloud service, but ensure the backup is clean and not infected.\\n\\n10. **Consider Professional Help**: If you find evidence that your device has been compromised or if you’re unsure about the steps to take, consider consulting with a cybersecurity professional or your organization’s IT department.\\n\\n11. **Educate Yourself**: Take this opportunity to learn about phishing attacks and how to recognize malicious links in the future to prevent similar incidents.\\n\\nIf you notice any signs of compromise, such as unauthorized access to accounts, unexpected pop-ups, or system slowdowns, it may be necessary to perform a full system restore or reinstall the operating system.\" additional_kwargs={} example=False\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# System: \"You are a chief, you want to ask me some things to find out my favorite Asian dish\"\n","# AI: \"Where are you from\"\n","# Human: \"Egypt\"\n","# AI: \"Do you like spicy food?\"\n","# Human: \"Not too much\"\n","# AI: \"Do you suffer from diabetes?\"\n","# Human: \"yes\"\n","\n","base_conversation = [\n","    SystemMessage(content=\"You are a chief, you want to ask me some things to find out my favorite Asian dish\"),\n","    AIMessage(content=\"Where are you from?\"),\n","    HumanMessage(content=\"Egypt\"),\n","    AIMessage(content=\"Do you like spicy food?\"),\n","    HumanMessage(content=\"Not too much\"),\n","    AIMessage(content=\"Do you suffer from diabetes?\"),\n","    HumanMessage(content=\"yes\"),\n","]\n","\n","ai_response = chat(base_conversation)\n","\n","print(ai_response)"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-11T11:50:25.507917Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-11T11:50:25.508184Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-11T11:50:26.872577Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-11T11:50:25.508167Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-11T11:50:26.871869Z"},"id":"VMRFqzpiRD52","outputId":"a44f66cf-804a-4e46-bb1f-3074d11107b8"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"content='Are you looking for a dish that is low in carbohydrates?' additional_kwargs={} example=False\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":["base_convesation = [\n","\n","    SystemMessage(content=\"You are a chief, you want to ask me some things to find out my favorite Asian dish, please ask one question\")\n","\n","]\n","\n","ai_response =None\n","\n","for i  in range (4):\n","    ai_response=chat(base_convesation)\n","    print(ai_response.content)\n","    base_convesation.append(ai_response)\n","    user_response=HumanMessage(content=input())\n","\n","    base_convesation.append(user_response)\n","\n","human_final_message = HumanMessage(content=\"And now.
